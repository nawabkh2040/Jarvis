 Lori,

I too am new to mice. You've already gotten good advice so I'll just add a few things.

Bedding/substrate- Stay away from pine and cedar shavings. They are toxic to mice. Unscented aspen shavings would be a good choice.

Feeding- A good quality mouse mix should be available at local pet/farm type stores. This coupled with fresh fruits and veggies should provide plenty of enrichment for your mice.

Water is Very important. A water bottle is the safest way to offer it, but as Sprinkles mentioned, it can be a challenge to little ones. I offer water both in a bowl and a bottle to mine so that I can be sure they are getting enough. The bowls are the small stainless steel ones sold at pet stores for use with small animals. They are heavy and tip proof. When fresh fruits and veggies are offered in the afternoons, I leave the water bottle off so that they will drink the water in the bowl. Then I add the the bottle back on when they get their evening mouse mix.

Mice love to have things to climb and hide in. You can make your own using cardboard boxes and tubes or there are lots of things available at pet stores in the ferret/to
