AI response For Prompt what is machine learning
 ****************************************************************



Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching a computer system to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed to do so. This is achieved through the use of algorithms and statistical models that allow the system to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on new data. Machine Learning has a wide range of applications, including data mining, natural language processing, image and speech recognition, and predictive analytics.
