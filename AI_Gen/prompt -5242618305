Here’s how AI Ride works:

Employee requests sick leave through the app: When an employee is feeling sick and needs to take time off from work, they can easily request sick leave through the AI Ride app. With just a few clicks, the employee can provide details such as their symptoms, expected duration of leave, and any specific requests they have.

2. AI Ride suggests the most suitable doctor: Based on the employee’s symptoms and location, AI Ride suggests the most suitable doctor for them. This ensures that the employee gets the necessary medical attention and avoids unnecessary visits to multiple doctors.

3. Doctor appointment booking: Once the employee selects a doctor, AI Ride automatically books an appointment for them. The employee can choose the most convenient time slot from the available options.

4. Confirmation and reminders: AI Ride sends confirmation messages to both the employee and the doctor to ensure that the appointment is booked successfully. The employee also receives reminders about their appointment to avoid missing it.
